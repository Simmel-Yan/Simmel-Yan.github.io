I am a Ph.D. candidate currently studying at the [Nankai-Baidu Joint Laboratory](https://nbjl.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), as well as [Parallel and Distributed Software Technology Lab](https://nbjl.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm).  As the principal investigator, we are conducting interdisciplinary research in the fields of high-performance computing, information security, and data compression. Our ultimate goal is to develop a high-performance compression framework tailored for large-scale biological data. I, along with Dr. HuiD Ma, Dr. HaoN Xie, Master YingF Zheng, and Master YanF Ding, have jointly initiated an open-source project called BioCompressor. All the developed algorithm components can be found on my [GitHub Site](https://fahaihi.github.io).
