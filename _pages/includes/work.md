#### üéô Parallel Compression Algorithms Design for Large-Scale Genomics Sequencing Data
- **2022-now, BGI Company Collaboration Project**
- (1) This project utilizes the CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI parallel programming model to design a large-scale parallel compression framework for FastQ and FastA format data, efficiently storing genomic sequencing data and reducing the cost of storage infrastructure for enterprises. 
- (2) I lead a data compression team and have designed a series of parallel compression algorithms for quality scores, long-read, and short-read data. This work involves multiple interdisciplinary fields, such as GPU-similar acceleration, deep learning, and data compression.

#### üìö Study on Algorithm Design for Automatic Generation of Schematic Diagrams Simulated Integrated Circuit Netlists and Parallel Optimization
- **2022-2023, Supported by National Science Foundation of China, NO.62141412**
- (1) This project aims to improve the utilization of the layout area, reduce the total wiring length, and optimize the aesthetic quality of the layout and wiring results as the overall objectives. It aims to design a heuristic layout and wiring algorithm suitable for medium and small-scale circuit layouts. This algorithm will facilitate users in checking the logical errors of circuit modules before actual wiring, ensuring a more efficient and error-free layout process. 
- (2) This project is primarily implemented using C++, Python, CUDA, and MPI programming languages. As a critical participant in the project, my responsibility is to design aesthetic evaluation metrics based on convolutional neural networks and genetic clustering algorithms.

#### üìö Study on Methods for Sensitive Sequence Identification in Genomic Data
- **2020-2022, Supported by Guangxi Graduate Education Innovation Program, YCSW.2021020**
- (1) Sensitive sequence identification is essential for information security in the era of big biological data. To accurately and efficiently identify sensitive sequences with high error rates, a parallel algorithm named CGPU-F3SR is proposed, which combines filtering and similarity calculation. 
- (2) This project utilizes CUDA, OpenMP, Python, and C programming languages. As the project leader, I am responsible for developing the algorithm model and implementing the programming.

#### üßë‚Äçüé® PMathematical Models Design for Guangxi Scientific Research Integrity System
- **2019-2020, Supported by Guangxi Science and Technology Department, ZL.19107008**
- (1) This project focuses on the actual situation of research credit construction in Guangxi. It aims to construct a credit evaluation model for research project applicants using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). By quantifying the research integrity behaviour of project applicants, it aims to provide a reference basis for project application reviews conducted by the administrative authorities in Guangxi's science and technology sector.\newline
- (2) The project is developed using Java programming language, Vue framework, and Spring Boot framework. As a critical participant in the project, my responsibilities include algorithm design and implementation.
